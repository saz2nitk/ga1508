You have a list and the task is to find the mean of that list. Do not use any libraries (sklearn numpy)?

no function --> resuability
variable name
variable name and method name are same --- should never be.
fuction name or variable name should never be using a reserved keyword
name of function should convey exactly what it does 
Readability -- comments is a nice thing to have
We shouldnt use inline comments as far as possible.
modular

pep8, pep257 -- compliances in python
highly maintainable
is your code scalable?
horizontal scaling 
vertical scaling

explainability
code explainability
model explainability --- ML/DL model

Document Summarisation

We are always going to take the first line.
We'll remove all sentences with less than 4 words.
We'll take the top 5 sentences in terms of length and concatenate them with first line.

Pre-processing
Special characcter removal (not full stops)
Convert to lower case apart from first letter of the sentence.


Input data --> passed in form of text file
writing function
writing classes - 
	writing two classes
		- pre-processing
			- function 1 -- lower case
			- function 2 -- special char removal
		- summarisation
			- function1 -- sentence split
			- function2 -- group first sentence and rest of sentences
			- function3 -- finds length of sentences
			- function4 -- find top 5 sentences
			- function5 -- concatenates first sentence and top 5  rest sentence
